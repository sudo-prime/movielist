hi is gray

i liek movie

here are sum i like

1) blade runner (the directors cut from the 90s) - indiana jones is back at it again with another CRAZY adventure where he assassinates the terminator and then they cry together good movie
2) synechdoche new york - a movie about a movie about a movie about a movie about a sad old guy lol
3) being john malkovich - a movie about a sad BALD man so its diferent tm
4) adaptation - "hey gray the last 3 movies on this list are by the same director you must really like him" i do. this movie also features nic cage playing as twin brothers and its actually good. thats right. a good nic cage performance. TWO good nic cage performances. in the same movie. definitely not filmed in our own reality stay woke 
5) reservoir dogs - quentin tortilla is back at it again playing a minor role in his own movie and dies instantly like a loser lmao
6) pretty much any quentitn tortilla movie cuz theyre fun and entertaining
7) if you havent ironically watched every fast and the furious movie you pretty much have to. i have this theory that fast and the furious is basically dragonball z for americans. dont believe me? vin diesel constantly grows in power (racing ability) throughout the franchise (8 countem EIGHT movies) and past enemies he fights eventually turn into his allies. its actually amazing + dwayne the rock johnson is unironically a recurring character now
8) baby driver - edgar allen poe is back at it again with another funny racing man movie
9) hardcore henry - a guy with $3 made an action movie (and its p good)
10) children of men - SAD BOYS ONLY no happy people allowed ITS REAL SAD HOURS SMASH THAT MF LIKE BUTTON IF YOU UP
11) logan - basically the plot of the last movie + borderline furry superheros (who doesnt)
12) snowpiercer - "all you had to do was follow the damn train CJ" the movie
13) there was this really good heist movie where all of the guys call themselves variations of "Steve" and it sounds ridiculous but it was actually entertaining so if you can find it watch it
14) idk im out of ideas

those are my actual recommendations cuz they are all good movies not like fred 2 night of the living fred or some shit

this is supposed to be a csv so here u go: ,
